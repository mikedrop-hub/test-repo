Clone repo with
	git clone URL
Then cd into directory and run the setup.sh file with bash
	bash setup.sh
Activate the automatically created venv
	source .venv/bin/activate
Do this in a order that makes it work
	sudo dpkg -i deb_dist/python3-my-expense-app_1.1-1_all.deb
	//or whatever its named inside the deb_dist file
	
	python3 setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb
	
Importantly:
run pipx install . --force
//Do not forget the dot between install and --force!


This works pretty well icl
cd test-repo/
  actvenv
  sudo dpkg -i deb_dist/python3-my-expense-app_1.1-1_all.deb
  python3 setup.py     
  pipx install . --force
